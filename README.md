# SnakesvsBlocks
a JavaFX application for the game - Snakes vs Block.The objective of this game is to create a chain of balls that has enough power to break through numbered blocks. If your chain hits a block that it can't break, you die. Rules for the gameplay are mentioned below - 1) The snake is a collection of n balls arranged linearly. (n >= 0) 2) Snake can move in 3 directions: forward, left, and right. 3) The snake always moves forward until it encounters a block. 4) Blocks and Walls appear randomly during the gameplay. 5) Each block has a value, which represents the points made by the player when the snake eats it. After eating the block the length of the snake decreases by the value of the block 6) Blocks may occur independently, or in a chain. Atleast one of the block in a chain should have a value less than the length of the snake. 7) Walls may occur in different lengths, but should not divide the screen in two halves at any time. That is, length of the wall should be strictly less than the length of screen. 8) Snake should not be able to move across the wall. 9) A snake may encounter 4 types of tokens during the gameplay. a) Ball: A ball has a value written over it. The length of the snake increases by the value of the ball if it eats the ball. b) Destroy Blocks: Destroy all the blocks present on the screen. Value of each block destroyed is added to the score of the player.
